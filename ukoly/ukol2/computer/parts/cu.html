    <h1>Control Unit</h1>
    <span>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_unit">Wikipedia</a>, the free encyclopedia</span>
    <p>The control unit (CU) is a component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that directs the operation of the processor. A CU typically uses a binary decoder to convert coded instructions into timing and control signals that direct the operation of the other units (memory, arithmetic logic unit and input and output devices, etc.).</p>
    <p>Most computer resources are managed by the CU. It directs the flow of data between the CPU and the other devices. John von Neumann included the control unit as part of the Von Neumann architecture.[1] In modern computer designs, the control unit is typically an internal part of the CPU with its overall role and operation unchanged since its introduction.</p>
